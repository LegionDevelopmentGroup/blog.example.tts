# TTS of the Bible

This contains various scripts to parse, generate audio clips, transcribe audio clips, validate, and create playlists. 

## Source Text

The raw text used for parsing is provided as [douay_rheims.txt](douay_rheims.txt) along with a [diff patch](douay_rheims.diff) for transforming the original version downloaded from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8300). This can be done using the following commands:

        curl https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/8300/pg8300.txt --output gutenberg.org_cache_epub_8300_pg8300.txt
        sed 's/\r$//' gutenberg.org_cache_epub_8300_pg8300.txt > douay_rheims.txt
        patch -u -b douay_rheims.txt -i douay_rheims.diff

## Data Files

The repo also includes the parsed data for each book of the bible in the [data](data/) folder. There is one json file per book which contains the parsed structure of the bible. These are generated by [structure_bible.rb](structure_bible.rb) and used by all other scripts as an input.

## Transcript Files

The Whisper transcript files are also included for the first 5 books of the Bible. These are generated using [verify_book_audio.rb](verify_book_audio.rb). 

## Verification Files

The verification files contains 2 sets of files.

1. That contain the comparisions details per entry in the book (e.g. [douay_rheims_genesis_verify.json](verify_files/douay_rheims_genesis_verify.json).
2. The statistical totals regarding errors found in each book (e.g. [douay_rheims_genesis_verify_status.json](verify_files/douay_rheims_genesis_verify_status.json)
